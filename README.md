To compile your own release follow these steps

1. Download the files
2. extract and open main.rs
3. replace API_Key_Here with your OpenAI API key
4. Save
5. Test it with "cargo run"
6. If you recieve no errors, the you can build it with "cargo build --release"

With this you can take OpenAi with you anywhere, throw it on a USB and ask it questions. 

Possible security issues would be the hardcoded api key. Make sure to save the compiled program in a safe spot.
